    <p>Here is a really inspiration quote I found on the internet: "<i>The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers.

    <p>My three favorite actors are</p>
    <span>Dwayne Johnson</span><span>Ryan Reynolds</span><span>Benedict Cumberbatch</span>
